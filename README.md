**Project Abstract:**

  When a student or staff wants to attend some event like conference, training, seminar, etc. or go on a long-term event like an internship, we must submit an On Duty request in paper and gain clearance from many college chancellors, which is a lengthy procedure. The same procedure is used when we need to request authorization for pre-informed leave. Also, getting some academic details like internship profiles, course certificates is a tedious and complicated task when collecting from entire college students. So, we plan to create a website portal termed STUDENT REFINED REPORT PORTAL which makes it easier and more technologically advanced, to simplify and save as much as paper work and time for both students and authorities by finishing as much as the necessary procedure with ease.

**Implementation**

In this project, the current system framework is framed using HTML5, MySQL, and PHP Admin. While creating the web application's front end, HTML offers a pretty convenient development environment.
The entire system's online application makes it simple to access the system from anywhere. There is no need to physically gather and submit the leave application forms. The time needed to complete the process has drastically decreased. After application, the database is automatically updated at the end of the procedure, saving department personnel from having to manually enter the data. Data Redundancy is averted, which lowers the occurrence of errors, because the database was established using MySQL and PHP Admin is designed to handle MySQL administration. 
Additionally, collecting student reports throughout their academic careers and allowing the authorities access to those reports eliminates a great deal of the burden associated with having to acquire reports and proofs from superiors whenever they are needed. Additionally, the work and certification completed by students, staff members, and others can be kept, distributed, and secured in a way that is simple to access, making it possible to use them whenever necessary.


Students are able to login to their account using the given username and password as shown in Fig. 5, after logging in, students are able to provide Leave, OD request and Report submission as seen in Fig. 6. Students can also see the latest notification of approval or rejection of request in their homepage

To request a leave, for an example, student has to click the Leave Request button in the homepage and is allowed to enter the provided details, as seen in Fig. 7. After entering the correct details, the request will be transferred to his/her mentor. If wrong details are entered, the form wouldn't be submitted.



After entering and submitting the form, the request is seen in the homepage of staff, as shown in Fig. 8. The staff clicks the request and performs approval or rejection with proper decision. If mentor tries to reject the request, they have to provide the reason for denial. After approval, the request is transferred to Class Coordinator. The same process is repeated and the request is transferred to the Head of Department.
