**Project Abstract:**

  When a student or staff wants to attend some event like conference, training, seminar, etc. or go on a long-term event like an internship, we must submit an On Duty request in paper and gain clearance from many college chancellors, which is a lengthy procedure. The same procedure is used when we need to request authorization for pre-informed leave. Also, getting some academic details like internship profiles, course certificates is a tedious and complicated task when collecting from entire college students. So, we plan to create a website portal termed STUDENT REFINED REPORT PORTAL which makes it easier and more technologically advanced, to simplify and save as much as paper work and time for both students and authorities by finishing as much as the necessary procedure with ease.
